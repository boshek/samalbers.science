title: About Sam
---

I am a data scientist living in Victoria, BC, Canada. I acknowledge and thank the Lkwungen People, also known as the Songhees,  Esquimalt, and Beecher Bay First Nations communities, for allowing me to live, work and play on their lands. I spend most of my computer time in R. My goal with this blog is to mostly ramble. And perhaps learn a little about the web. Or some random thing that I am interested in. One day I hope to build a weather station. Then hopefully I'll blog about it. Let's all look forward to that day. 

The repository that builds this blog is located at https://github.com/boshek/samalbers.science

This blog is built using the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) via Hugo using the [hugo future imperfect theme] (https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect).
