I am a data scientist living in Victoria, BC, Canada. I spend most of my time in R. My goal with this blog is to mostly ramble. And perhaps learn a little about the web. Or some random thing that I am interested in. One day I hope to build a weather station. Then hopefully I'll blog about it. Let's all look forward to that day.
