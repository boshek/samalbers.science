I acknowledge and thank the Lkwungen People, also known as the Songhees, Esquimalt, and Beecher Bay First Nations communities, for allowing me to live, work and play on their lands. I spend most of my computer time in R. My goal with this blog is to mostly ramble. And perhaps learn a little about the web. Or some random thing that I am interested in. One day I hope to build a weather station. Then hopefully I’ll blog about it. Let’s all look forward to that day.\nThe repository that builds this blog is located at https://github.com/boshek/samalbers.science"
