    "text": "Packages\nThankfully there is the R package — spotifyr — that makes requesting data from the spotify API very easy. Since spotifyr is on CRAN we can install it like usual.\n\ninstall.packages('spotifyr')\n\nFor this post I am also using the following packages which you will need to install.\n\ninstall.packages('dplyr')\ninstall.packages('usethis')\ninstall.packages('ggplot2')\ninstall.packages('tidyr')\n\nand load:\n\nlibrary(spotifyr)\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nlibrary(usethis)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nThere is some hocus-pocus to set up your credentials to access the spotify data which does require a paid spotify account. The spotifyr developer provides some nice instructions here and the spotify developer guide provides a few more details. Probably the most important thing to note here is that you want to save your spotify credentials in your .Renviron file. If you’ve never dealt with environment variables in R before, Efficient R programming provides a succinct description. In a nutshell our .Renviron file is a way for us to provide the value of a variable consistently across sessions and outside of a script. I always edit it with the usethis package:\n\nedit_r_environ()\n\nSetting up your credentials as environment variables is a one-time thing. After that, functions in the spotifyr package will just work as they all call get_spotify_access_token() by default. Now that I have all credential sorted out let’s try and see what we can find out about Buck from the spotify API.\n\n\n\n\nbuck_raw <- get_artist_audio_features('buck owens')\n\nWarning in dplyr::left_join(., track_audio_features, by = \"album_id\"): Each row in `x` is expected to match at most 1 row in `y`.\nℹ Row 1 of `x` matches multiple rows.\nℹ If multiple matches are expected, set `multiple = \"all\"` to silence this\n  warning.\n\ndim(buck_raw)\n\n[1] 1983   39\n\n\nThis is lots of information (39 columns just on Buck!).

    "text": "Summaries of Buck\nWith this data in hand I’ll make some rapid fire summaries of Buck Owens. These summaries turned out not to be particularly compelling radio material but I’m not going to let that deter me. Taking cue from the spotifyr package, what is Buck’s most common key?\n\nbuck %>% \n    count(key_mode, sort = TRUE)\n\n   key_mode   n\n1  G# major 326\n2   A major 308\n3  D# major 213\n4   G major 187\n5   E major 165\n6  A# major 137\n7   C major 119\n8   F major 108\n9  F# major 108\n10  D major 101\n11 C# major  94\n12  B major  81\n13  B minor   5\n14 C# minor   5\n15  F minor   5\n16  D minor   4\n17  E minor   4\n18 A# minor   3\n19 F# minor   3\n20  G minor   3\n21 G# minor   3\n22 D# minor   1\n\n\nThe man loved G#/Ab major. It is a bit of unusual key and you can readily find some speculation online about why Buck might have tuned down a half step. And not much in the minor keys. I guess country finds sadness another way. How about time signature?\n\nbuck %>% \n    count(time_signature, sort = TRUE)\n\n  time_signature    n\n1              4 1747\n2              3  214\n3              5   18\n4              1    3\n5              0    1\n\n\nA few suspect data points (zero time signature?) but overall Buck made a career of keep things pretty straight forward. Mostly 4/4 with the occasional waltz.\nWhat about Buck’s album output. Let’s plot his cumulative albums over time:\n\ncumulative_albums <- buck %>% \n  select(album_release_year, album_name) %>% \n  distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) %>% \n  count(album_release_year) %>% \n  arrange(album_release_year) %>% \n  mutate(albums = cumsum(n))\n\nggplot(cumulative_albums, aes(x = album_release_year, y = albums)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk so this data isn’t particularly good. Likely what would be help is an original_release_date column. Buck was most active in the sixties while the data suggests his output was highest during the mid-nineties. Presumably these are re-issue dates. Still good to know — can’t rely on that year data.\nThe audio features available through the spotify api are very interesting numeric summaries of songs and will be fun to play around with. I won’t go into descriptions of each audio feature but we will calculate histograms of all Buck’s songs for each feature. Most features range between 0 and 1 so the distributions can give us a sense of Buck’s music tendencies.\n\nbuck %>% \n  select(danceability:tempo, duration_ms) %>% \n  gather() %>% \n  mutate(key = tools::toTitleCase(key)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = value), fill = \"blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~key, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really like looking at these distributions. Quite what they represent (or how they are derived) is something that I haven’t quite wrapped my brain around. However they do offer us some high level assessment of an artist’s catalogue. If the album release date info was better we could do some interesting retrospectives. In another post I’ll try to find a better example. Buck’s songs are reasonably dancy, don’t vary much in length and are very positive. This conflicts with my prior of country music being sad and is also likely an interesting hypothesis to further test in a future post.\nLastly let’s have a look and see if danceability is related to tempo.\n\ncor.test(buck$danceability, buck$tempo, method = \"spearman\")\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  buck$danceability and buck$tempo\nS = 1529672927, p-value = 2.015e-15\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n       rho \n-0.1770145 \n\nbuck %>% \n  filter(danceability != 0) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = tempo, y = danceability)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") \n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a very slight and negative relationship with danceability and tempo. If you are really dancing, you probably want that song to be short. We all only have so much stamina.\nThis has been a short usecase of using the spotify API and in particular the spotifyr package. It is actually pretty exciting to have so much music info at your fingertips."

    "text": "This is a bit of a grandiose title for a blog post. But it is important to have ambition right? In 2003, after releasing Michigan, Sufjan Stevens announced his intention to release one album as an ode to each of the fifty American states, appropriately named the Fifty States Project. Despite only completing two albums (the other being Illinois) I appreciate his ambition, and desire to be thorough (and also those wacky costumes).\nIt is that thoroughness which resonates with me and what I’d like to apply to the Hydrology CRAN Task View. Myself, along with Sam Zipper and Ilaria Prosdocimi, maintain the Hydrology task view with the express goal of creating a comprehensive and high–quality list of R packages related to the field of Hydrology. We introduced the task view, at a very high level, over at the rOpenSci blog last year. This post is the first in a series where I try some aspect of every package included in the task view. If Stevens’ can declared his Fifty States Project why can’t I take on the Hydrology Task View Project? My first foray into this is not terribly ambitious as I am going to discuss one of my own packages, rsoi, which was recently updated on CRAN with a new version."

    "section": "rsoi",
    "text": "rsoi\nrsoi started out as a package to acquire El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) data and import it into R. This is the data that climate scientists use to determine which phase of the oscillation we are currently experiencing. Since that initial version, rsoi has gained several datasets and now functions more generally as simple R interface to as many climate indices as we can collect. All the raw data that rsoi accesses is directly from the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospehric Administration (NOAA). Packages like rsoi facilitate reproducible workflows by providing convenient functions to access data stored on the web. (Sidebar: the most comprehensive package for accessing all manner of NOAA data is the rnoaa package by Scott Chamberlain which is also in the Hydrology task view 😉). As of version 0.5.1 rsoi provides access to these data (with the corresponding rsoi function in parentheses):\n\nSouthern Oscillation Index (download_soi)\nOceanic Nino Index (download_oni)\nNorth Pacific Gyre Oscillation (download_npgo)\nNorth Atlantic Oscillation (download_nao)\nArctic Oscillation (download_ao)\nAntarctic Oscillation (download_aao)\nMultivariate ENSO Index Version 2 (download_mei)\n\nrsoi is on CRAN so installation proceeds typically:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rsoi\")\n\nThe usage of a rsoi revolves around the download_* functions. For example if you want to read in the Oceanic Nino Index data you can run this code:\n\nlibrary(rsoi)\n\noni <- download_oni()\nhead(oni)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n   Year Month Date       dSST3.4   ONI ONI_month_window phase             \n  <int> <ord> <date>       <dbl> <dbl> <chr>            <fct>             \n1  1950 Jan   1950-01-01   -1.62 NA    <NA>             <NA>              \n2  1950 Feb   1950-02-01   -1.32 -1.34 JFM              Cool Phase/La Nina\n3  1950 Mar   1950-03-01   -1.07 -1.17 FMA              Cool Phase/La Nina\n4  1950 Apr   1950-04-01   -1.11 -1.18 MAM              Cool Phase/La Nina\n5  1950 May   1950-05-01   -1.37 -1.07 AMJ              Cool Phase/La Nina\n6  1950 Jun   1950-06-01   -0.74 -0.85 MJJ              Cool Phase/La Nina\n\n\nEach climate index in rsoi is accessed by functions of the format download_[index abbreviation]. A quick plot of the ONI data demonstrates that we are currently in the Neutral ENSO phase (as of 19/01/2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the basic usage of rsoi that has been in place since it was first published to CRAN. Luckily Elio Campitelli found rsoi and made it better:\n\n\nMe: \"I've been downloading and reshaping ENSO data often. Maybe I should build an #rstats package to do it. \"Also me: \"Mh.. I wonder if someone else has already done it\"The internets: \"Here you go\"https://t.co/CC7hVFXEjY\n\n— Elio Campitelli (@d_olivaw) October 17, 2019\n\n\nAs of version 0.5.1, thanks to several contributions by Elio, rsoi now will optionally use a cache so that data are downloaded only once per R session. Not only this is more polite to NOAA as the data provider, this also provides some optimization for processes that repeateadly call rsoi functions. You can either use this cache in memory:\n\nlibrary(tictoc)\n\n## accessing from the web\ntic()\nsoi <- download_soi(use_cache = TRUE)\ntoc()\n\n1.028 sec elapsed\n\n##same session, accessing from the memory cache\ntic()\nsoi <- download_soi(use_cache = TRUE)\ntoc()\n\n0.006 sec elapsed\n\n\nOr you can save it locally:\n\nmei <- download_mei(use_cache = TRUE, file = \"mei.csv\")\n\nSubsequent calls of download_mei that have the use_cache argument set to TRUE, will automatically import that data stored on disk rather than access it from the web. This works for each function in rsoi. This is a really nice contribution from Elio.\nA knock on CRAN Task Views, meritted or not, that I have heard is that they are simply an unvetted collection of packages. To a certain extent this is true as there is no formal process whereby a package gains acceptance to a task view. Rather package maintainers usually simply ask to be added and they are. This series of blog posts (n currently equalling 1) is designed to provide some additional exploration of packages in the Hydrology task view. Like Sufjan Stevens, this is an ambitious goal. However, writing a blog is much easier than making an album (have you heard Illinois?) so maybe I have a better chance."

    "text": "The arrow package\nOne of my main goals at the conference was to find out new ways of dealing with very big flat files. I work in an environment where big flat files are sort of our only option. Adding them to a proper database is not currently possible but I was hopeful that maybe the Apache Arrow project might offer up some solutions. I was not disappointed. Neal Richardson with UrsaLabs gave a great presentation on the status of the project with a specific focus on the R package arrow.\nHere I am mostly parroting what Neal did with his presentation just replacing taxi data with Canadian hydrometric data. Whether we are provisioned data that way or create it ourselves, consider data organized in a hierarchical folder structure. Here at the top level we have Canadian province:\n\n\n/Users/samalbers/_dev/gh_repos/samalbers.science/data/rivers-data\n├── AB\n├── BC\n├── NL\n├── SK\n└── YT\n\n\nwithin each province folder we have year:\n\n\n/Users/samalbers/_dev/gh_repos/samalbers.science/data/rivers-data/AB\n└── 2017\n\n\nwithin each year folder we have month\n\n\n/Users/samalbers/_dev/gh_repos/samalbers.science/data/rivers-data/AB/2017\n├── 01\n├── 02\n├── 03\n├── 04\n├── 05\n├── 06\n├── 07\n├── 08\n├── 09\n├── 10\n├── 11\n└── 12\n\n\nand finally within that directory you actually have your data file:\n\n\n/Users/samalbers/_dev/gh_repos/samalbers.science/data/rivers-data/AB/2017/01\n└── rivers.parquet\n\n\nNormally in this situation my approach would be to do some sort of iterative process over each file (mind you still making use of arrow to read the parquet file):\n\ndf_rivs <- list.files(here('data/rivers-data/'), pattern = '*.parquet', recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE) %>% \n  map_dfr(read_parquet)\n\nFrom there we might execute some typical sequence designed to filter our data down to a more manageable size.\n\ndf_rivs %>% \n  filter(year(Date) == 2017) %>% \n  filter(Parameter == 'Flow') %>% \n  arrange(Date)\n\n# A tibble: 309,314 × 5\n   STATION_NUMBER Date       Parameter  Value Symbol\n   <chr>          <date>     <chr>      <dbl> <chr> \n 1 05AA008        2017-01-01 Flow       1.75  B     \n 2 05AA024        2017-01-01 Flow       8.67  <NA>  \n 3 05AA035        2017-01-01 Flow       1.56  B     \n 4 05AC003        2017-01-01 Flow       0.954 B     \n 5 05AC012        2017-01-01 Flow       0.736 B     \n 6 05AC941        2017-01-01 Flow       1.03  <NA>  \n 7 05AD003        2017-01-01 Flow       3.77  B     \n 8 05AD007        2017-01-01 Flow      24.6   B     \n 9 05AE027        2017-01-01 Flow       4.81  B     \n10 05AG006        2017-01-01 Flow      24.7   B     \n# … with 309,304 more rows\n\n\nWhat we learned in Neal’s presentation was the magic of the open_dataset function and specifically its ability to map hierarchical directory structure to virtual columns in your data. If we read just one parquet file, it is apparent that there aren’t any province, year or month columns:\n\nread_parquet(here('data/rivers-data/AB/2017/01/rivers.parquet'))\n\n# A tibble: 3,131 × 5\n   STATION_NUMBER Date       Parameter  Value Symbol\n * <chr>          <date>     <chr>      <dbl> <chr> \n 1 05AA008        2017-01-01 Flow       1.75  B     \n 2 05AA024        2017-01-01 Flow       8.67  <NA>  \n 3 05AA035        2017-01-01 Flow       1.56  B     \n 4 05AC003        2017-01-01 Flow       0.954 B     \n 5 05AC012        2017-01-01 Flow       0.736 B     \n 6 05AC941        2017-01-01 Flow       1.03  <NA>  \n 7 05AD003        2017-01-01 Flow       3.77  B     \n 8 05AD007        2017-01-01 Flow      24.6   B     \n 9 05AE027        2017-01-01 Flow       4.81  B     \n10 05AG006        2017-01-01 Flow      24.7   B     \n# … with 3,121 more rows\n\n\nInstead, if we assign partitions, using a vector based on the directory structure, open_dataset can use that information to efficiently subset a larger dataset.\n\nrivs <- open_dataset(here('data/rivers-data/'), partitioning = c('province','year', 'month'))\nrivs\n\nFileSystemDataset with 60 Parquet files\nSTATION_NUMBER: string\nDate: date32[day]\nParameter: string\nValue: double\nSymbol: string\nprovince: string\nyear: int32\nmonth: int32\n\nSee $metadata for additional Schema metadata\n\n\nBest of all, the select, filter, group_by and rename dplyr verbs are implemented much like dbplyr and your query is executed lazily taking advantage of both the directory structure and the parquet files.\n\nriver_data <- rivs %>% \n  filter(year == 2017) %>% \n  filter(province %in% c('BC', 'YT', 'AB', 'SK', 'NL')) %>% \n  filter(Parameter == 'Flow') %>% \n  group_by(STATION_NUMBER, province) %>% \n  collect() %>% \n  arrange(Date)\n\nWhile YMMV depending on the size of your data, using folder structure is a nifty way to only access the data we actually need. The Apache Arrow project, and for R users the arrow package, are proceeding very nicely. Now that we have efficiently pared down our river flow data, the next exciting thing I want to explore is some really cool developments in the ggplot2 sphere."

    "text": "The ggtext package\nThe ggtext package by Claus Wilke provides much improved rendering support for ggplot2. What feels like should a simple task (e.g. colour some portion of text) is sometimes quite onerous in ggplot2. Though the package is still in its infancy, ggtext is breaking trail on making these steps much easier by providing a mini markdown engine directly inside ggplot2. After audible ohhs and ahhs from the crowd while demoing ggtext, Claus observed “I can see this fills a need”. Already it provides some support for markdown and html rendering.\n\n\n\nSo how can we use it to better visualize our river data? Because ggtext has some minimal html rendering, we can actually include images right inside the ggplot call. My idea was to try and see if I could include provincial flags as axes labels in the plot. This requires steps to:\n\nget the files\nextract the province name from the file name\ncreate a new column in our rivers data because the provinces aren’t labelled in the same way\nglue the image names with the html snippets\n\nI won’t go into too much detail but here are the steps:\n\nGet the Data\n\ndir.create(\"data/flags\")\n\ndownload.file(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/40/5440-004-BE91E74F/Flag-Alberta.jpg\", destfile = \"data/flags/AB.jpeg\")\ndownload.file(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/63/5263-004-1C2B7CDE/Flag-Yukon-Territory.jpg\", destfile = \"data/flags/YT.jpeg\")\ndownload.file(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/18/3918-004-9D01BB0E/Flag-Saskatchewan.jpg\", destfile = \"data/flags/SK.jpeg\")\ndownload.file(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/92/2992-004-54C721CF/Flag-Newfoundland-and-Labrador.jpg\", destfile = \"data/flags/NL.jpeg\")\ndownload.file(\"https://cdn.britannica.com/77/6877-004-26251B48/Flag-British-Columbia.jpg\", destfile = \"data/flags/BC.jpeg\")\n\n\n\nExtract Province\n\nflag_paths <- dir_ls(here('data/flags'), glob = '*.jpeg')\n\n\n\nCreate the Image Tags\n\nimg_tags <- glue(\"<img src='{flag_paths}' width='100' />\")\nnames(img_tags) <- basename(path_ext_remove(flag_paths))\n\nWe now have a named vector, which sources the appropriate provincial flag and is ready to render. This is accomplished by supplying the img_tags vector to the scale of your choice (here scale_x_discrete). ggplot2 knows how to actually render via ggtext::element_markdown. Otherwise we can simply treat this like any other ggplot. Here we are also calculating the annual sum of flows by each value of STATION_NUMBER.\n\nannual_flow <- river_data %>% \n  group_by(STATION_NUMBER, province) %>%\n  summarise(annual_flow = sum(Value, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nannual_flow %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = province, y = annual_flow)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = NULL, labels = img_tags) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_markdown(color = 'black', size = 11))\n\n\n\n\nSo I think this is pretty cool! We have images in the axes. AFAIK, this was previously impossible. Unfortunately this isn’t a particularly informative nor a nice looking plot. The next step in the workflow is to change that."

    "text": "Design Nicer Plots\nRStudio::conf had a thread of design thinking running through the workshops and conference. From the tidyverse’s near obsession with the design of their api to the inclusion of a live episode of Not So Standard deviation as a keynote, thinking about data science from a design perspective was a key theme that emerged for me. One example of this was Will Chase’s wonderful talk on the Glamour of Graphics. Will presented some very thoughtful approaches to creating better visualizations. I am going to butcher apply some of those approaches to our plot above.\n\nHydrologically Relevant\nFirst off, our plot is rather uninformative from hydrological perspective. A reasonable goal for this plot would be to aid the user to evaluate the distribution of annual river flow by province. In the above plot, the extreme values are stretching the scale too far out so let’s limit our analysis to rivers that output less that 10,000 m3/s per year.\n\nannual_flow_sub <- annual_flow %>%\n  filter(annual_flow < 10000)\n\nAlso the basic point plot doesn’t give us a great way to look at the distribution. For that task, another of Claus’s packages, ggridges comes in handy. ggridges is great for visualizing distributions and also forces us to flip the axes creating a more natural information flow (at least for those of us that read left to right).\n\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\nannual_flow_sub %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = province, x = annual_flow)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, labels = img_tags) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_markdown(color = 'black', size = 11))\n\n\n\n\nA great line from Will’s presentation pertained to white space:\n\nWhite space is like garlic; take the amount you think you need, then triple it.\n\nRight then let’s create some more white space by getting rid of the classic ggplot2 grey background. Here we can also tweak the height of the ridges to better show the distributions.\n\nannual_flow_sub %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = province, x = annual_flow)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(scale = 1) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, labels = img_tags) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_markdown(color = 'black', size = 11))\n\n\n\n\nOk looking a bit better. Another one of Will’s suggestion is to remove grid lines as much as possible. I basically agree and just keep the minor x values.\n\nannual_flow_sub %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = province, x = annual_flow)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(scale = 1) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, labels = img_tags) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_markdown(color = 'black', size = 11),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n✔️ Now we need some colour here. As Will stated colour is hard. My goal here is pretty modest. I just want to distinguish between provinces. To do that I am actually going to steal some colour from the flags and manually map those to fill in colour for the ridges. At the same time I am going to add some transparency to the ridges. I am going to deviate a little from Will’s advice here and keep the legend. I often get this way with plots and err on the side of caution. In this case I am thinking that folks won’t recognize the flags and therefore will use the legend. In general though I do like the approach of forcing legends to justify their existence - they need to earn their keep.\n\nflag_cols <- c('#3853a4',\n               '#f3ec18',\n               '#da1a33',\n               '#006b35',\n               '#0054a5')\n\nannual_flow_sub %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = province, x = annual_flow, fill = province)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(scale = 1, alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = flag_cols) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, labels = img_tags) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_markdown(color = 'black', size = 11),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = 'bottom',\n        legend.justification='right')\n\n\n\n\nLastly this plot needs a title, which according to Will’s sage advice is also a great way to remove axes labels - just explain it in the title.\n\nannual_flow_sub %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = province, x = annual_flow, fill = province)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(scale = 1, alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = NULL, values = flag_cols) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, labels = img_tags) +\n  labs(title = 'Smoothed distribution of annual flow of gauged rivers (m^3^ s^-1^) by province') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_markdown(color = 'black', size = 11),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title.position = 'plot',\n        plot.title = element_markdown(size = 15), \n        legend.position = 'bottom',\n        legend.justification='right')\n\n\n\n\nFrom a visualization perspective this isn’t perfect or even great. Legends are still problematic, I don’t even know if the flags add anything and grid lines feel like an addiction. Still I think this does provide a decent overview of the types of rivers that are gauged in each province. Remembering that we previously subset all our river flow data to less than 10000, the Yukon gauges bigger rivers while Saskatchewan gauges many smaller rivers. BC and Newfoundland gauge a wide range of rivers types. Alberta gauges rivers that reflect both its mountain and prairies landscapes."

    "text": "Lately I’ve been thinking about two things: getting old and Observable. Getting old is self-explanatory. ObservableJS (ojs) is maybe less so. Normally ojs is used in a JavaScript notebook environment that enables you to create interactive visualizations. This is a great platform and I suggest that if you are really interested in learning about ojs, you create an account there and start practicing. But sometimes, you want to take your interactive visualizations with you. This is where quarto comes in. Quarto is the successor to rmarkdown and is what this blog is written in. Like rmarkdown you can write prose and code in the same document. The biggest improvement with quarto is that you can also easily write code chunks in other language like python or ojs.\nThis post was intended to be about ojs and quarto using some data sourced from the National Hockey League api. So back to being the them of being old – I was wondering what happens to N.H.L. players when they get old? In particular what happens to their productivity? I was not able to find any interactive visualizations that satifactorily provided any ability to explore the question “At what age do N.H.L. players start declining in terms of production”? So then I ended having to learn about the NHL api and how I could get what I wanted out of it. That turned this into a post also about wrangling data from the N.H.L. api. Almost accidentally, this really highlights the power of quarto. I can much more easily wrangle data in R. Sure it is possible to do solely in ojs but for me it is easier in R. But then when I want to make the visualization, I can seamlessly switch to ojs in quarto.\nLet’s start with how we got the data. As is usual, we start with a pretty standard suite of tidyverse packages.\nlibrary(httr2)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(tidyr)"

Defining it here saves lots of space where I use it later on.\n\napi_message &lt;- function(..., verbose = TRUE) {\n  if (verbose) {\n    message(...)\n  }\n  invisible(TRUE)\n}\n\nquery_endpoint is the core function that actually sends a data request to the N.H.L. api. It takes an endpoint and a list of query parameters and returns a tibble with the results. It is always helpful to isolate the code that does the querying from the code that does the data wrangling.\n\nquery_endpoint &lt;- function(endpoint, ...) {\n  base_url &lt;- \"https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/\"\n  req &lt;- httr2::request(base_url) %&gt;%\n    httr2::req_url_path_append(endpoint)  %&gt;% \n    httr2::req_url_query(...)\n\n  resp &lt;- httr2::req_perform(req)\n\n  parsed &lt;- httr2::resp_body_json(resp, simplifyVector = TRUE)\n  parsed$copyright &lt;- NULL\n  dplyr::as_tibble(parsed[[1]])\n}\n\nWith every request to the N.H.L. api, the following note is returned in the response, specifying exactly who owns all the trademarks and logos. We drop it from the response because it is not really useful for our example but I am replicating it here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\n\nNHL and the NHL Shield are registered trademarks of the National Hockey League.

We are grabbing the arquero data wrangling library which as far as I can tell, is more or less dplyr for Observable JavaScript. Here is how they describe it:\n\nFollowing the relational algebra and inspired by the design of dplyr, Arquero provides a fluent API for manipulating column-oriented data frames.\n\nCool! I know I said that I was going to do most of my data warangling in R but it really does help to be able to do some of it in JavaScript.\n\nimport { aq, op } from '@uwdata/arquero';\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first function that we are is aq.from which is the equivalent of dplyr::as_tibble. It takes a data frame and converts it to an arquero table.\n\nageCurve = aq.from(transpose(ojs_age_curve_df))\nageCurve.view()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can do some data wrangling! Remember that we data coalated in the R step. The question we were interested in looking at was at what age do players start to decline? Our evaluation metric is even strength points per 60 minutes. Say, we are interested in looking at playing time for players that are 35 and older. We can filter the ageCurve table using syntax that is very similar to dplyr. The only thing to note is what goes inside the aq.escape function. This is because we are using a JavaScript function inside of a JavaScript function. This escapes the inner function so that it is evaluated as JavaScript.\n\nageCurve\n  .filter(aq.escape(d =&gt; d.currentAge &gt; 35))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk but you might asking yourself, why didn’t I just do that in dplyr? The beauty of these ojs chunks is that we can calculate this stuff on the fly so we can evaluate the same query for different age cutoffs. So the first we have to do is generate something interactive that we can create to define the age cutoff. For that we make use of Observable Inputs:\n\nviewof age_cutoff = Inputs.range([18, 40], {step: 1, value: 30})\n\nfilteredAgeCurve = ageCurve\n  .filter(aq.escape(d =&gt; d.currentAge &gt; age_cutoff))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat makes a nifty little slider whose value you can see in the box to the left. Now we can use that value to filter the ageCurve table.\nSo as you moved the slider, you are updating the filteredAgeCurve data in real time.\nArmed with this super power we also want to be able to provide some ability to highlight certain players. There are lots of ways you can do that. We are going for very simple and have a drop down menu that allows you to select a player and use the Inputs.select function to do that.\n\n\nCode\nviewof player = Inputs.select(filteredAgeCurve.dedupe(\"fullName\").orderby(\"fullName\").array(\"fullName\"), {\n  value: \"Sidney Crosby\"\n})\n\nsinglePlayer = filteredAgeCurve\n  .filter(aq.escape(d =&gt; d.fullName == player))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t get too exciting though until we start to visualize it. I am using the code-fold: true chunk option to hide the code that generates the drop down and the plot so that you can see the plot, the slider and the dropdown more closely together.\n\n\nCode\nPlot.plot({\n  y: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Even Strength Points per 60\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.lineY(filteredAgeCurve, {\n        x: \"age_at_start_of_season\", \n        y: \"even_strength_points_per_60\", \n        z: \"fullName\",\n        stroke: \"lightgray\",\n        curve: \"basis\"\n      }),\n    Plot.lineY(singlePlayer, {\n        x: \"age_at_start_of_season\", \n        y: \"even_strength_points_per_60\", \n        z: \"fullName\",\n        stroke: \"blue\",\n        curve: \"basis\"\n      })\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk so the players that are above 35… are pretty good. Like really good actually. So obviously there is so selection bias going on here. The players that are playing at 35 are the best of the best. There is not a huge drop off for them."

The beauty of these ojs chunks is that we can perform these operations on the fly using interactive tools like sliders, dropdown menus and radio buttons. For that we make use of Observable Inputs. Let’s make two of these: a slider and a dropdown. The slider (via Inputs.range) will define the variable age_cutoff and we can use that value to filter the ageCurve table updating the filteredAgeCurve data as a user interacts with the slider. We then take the filteredAgeCurve to determine unique player names and provide those as the values in the dropdown menu (via Inputs.select). One consequence of that is the values in the dropdown menu are dependent on the slider. Check for yourself. There are many fewer players to highlight at the age cutoff of 35.\nIt doesn’t get too exciting though until we start to visualize it. I am using the code-fold: true chunk option to hide the code that generates the plot and the inputs so that you can see the plot, the slider and the dropdown more closely together.

I find the code to create plots in ojs pretty accessible. Allison Horst wrote a really nice transition guide from ggplot2 to Plot that has proven to be very helpful. Plot draws from the same grammar of graphics that ggplot2 does so it’s spirit should feel familiar. Visual properties, like color, are mapped to variables in the data\nI have quite found the best way to write nice code in ojs but the results are undeniable. The plots are beautiful and interactive. Plot provides so many more opportunities for inteactivity than other interactive plotting libraries like plotly or ggiraph. Those are great libraries but creating visualization from scratch in ojs feel more natural and flexible."

    "text": "Conclusion\nI would be remiss to just have a pretty plot and not say anything about the data. The slider and the player selector both provide a simple way to explore the data. A couple points to note:\n\nThe overall trend is that many players start to decline at around 30. However there is some clear selection bias here. Players that are not producing at a high level are not going to be playing at 35.\nSidney Crosby is a beast. He is still producing at a consistnely high level at 35.\nThe players that you would expect, display truly stunning numbers. Nathan Mckinnon is just getting better and better and at 26, there is nothing to suggest that he is slowing down. Connor McDavid entered the league at a stunning pace and has consistency kept it up.\nJoel Pavelski is a complete of an outlier. He produced his best season at 38.\nCorey Perry is also an outlier but in the opposite direction. He has been in a strong decline since he was 30. And yet all he does is compete for Cups so clearly he’s still doing something right.\n\nTo wrap this up, I think that ojs is a great way to create interactive visualizations. I’ve tried to highlight the handoff from R to ojs and illustrate how you might go out create a plot.

We start with a pretty standard suite of tidyverse packages (and httr2).\nlibrary(httr2)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nNext we need to define some helper functions.\nconvert_time &lt;- function(time_str) {\n  # Split the time into minutes and seconds\n  time_parts &lt;- strsplit(time_str, \":\")[[1]]\n  # Convert to integers\n  minutes &lt;- as.integer(time_parts[1])\n  seconds &lt;- as.integer(time_parts[2])\n  # Convert the time to seconds\n  minutes * 60 + seconds\n}\n\ngenerate_year_string &lt;- function(start, end) {\n  # Extract the starting and ending years\n  startYear &lt;- as.numeric(substr(start, 1, 4))\n  endYear &lt;- as.numeric(substr(end, 1, 4))\n  # Generate the sequence of years\n  years &lt;- seq(startYear, endYear)\n  # Concatenate each year with the following one to get the year pairs\n  paste0(years, years + 1)\n}\nconvert_time turns a time string like 824:13 into the number of seconds.\nconvert_time(\"824:13\")\n\n[1] 49453\ngenerate_year_string is a helper function to generate the year strings that the NHL api expects.\ngenerate_year_string(19951996, 19981999)\n\n[1] \"19951996\" \"19961997\" \"19971998\" \"19981999\"\nThis is a function to help sending messages to the console. Defining it here saves lots of space where I use it later on.\napi_message &lt;- function(..., verbose = TRUE) {\n  if (verbose) message(...)\n  invisible(TRUE)\n}\nquery_endpoint is the core function that actually sends a data request to the NHL api. It takes an endpoint and a list of query parameters and returns a tibble of the results. It is always helpful to isolate the code that does the querying from the code that does the data wrangling.\nquery_endpoint &lt;- function(endpoint, ...) {\n  base_url &lt;- \"https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/\"\n  req &lt;- httr2::request(base_url) %&gt;%\n    httr2::req_url_path_append(endpoint) %&gt;%\n    httr2::req_url_query(...)\n\n  resp &lt;- httr2::req_perform(req)\n\n  parsed &lt;- httr2::resp_body_json(resp, simplifyVector = TRUE)\n  parsed$copyright &lt;- NULL\n  dplyr::as_tibble(parsed[[1]])\n}\nWith every request to the NHL api, the following note is returned in the response, specifying exactly who owns all the trademarks and logos. We drop it from the response because it is not really useful for our data wrangling example but I am replicating it here:\nThe get_points_by_age is the workhorse function for this post but is also one of those functions that does just what you want it to do but it may not be broadly useful. For example, this function requests data for every player that is currently on an NHL roster. That’s a lot of data and the service may get cranky with you for requesting that much.

    "text": "Working with Observable JavaScript\nThe rest of the code in this post is all written in ojs.\nWe do need import libraries (just like R) that don’t automatically come bundled with quarto. In this example, we are importing the arquero data wrangling library which as far as I can tell, is more or less dplyr for Observable JavaScript. Here is how they describe it:\n\ninspired by the design of dplyr, Arquero provides a fluent API for manipulating column-oriented data frames.\n\n\nimport { aq, op } from '@uwdata/arquero';\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool! I know I said that I was going to do most of my data wrangling in R but it really does help to be able to do some of it in JavaScript.\nThe first function that we are using is aq.from which is the equivalent of dplyr::as_tibble. It takes a data frame and converts it to an arquero table. We then call the view method on the table to see what it looks like. We are also need to transpose our data frame because arquero expects the data to be in a row-oriented format.\n\nageCurve = aq.from(transpose(ojs_age_curve_df))\nageCurve.view()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question we are interested in looking at was at what age do players start to decline? Our evaluation metric will be even strength points per 60 minutes. Say, we are interested in looking at playing time for players that are 35 and older. We can filter the ageCurve table using syntax that is very similar to dplyr. The only thing to note is what goes inside the aq.escape function. This is because we are using a JavaScript function inside of a JavaScript function. This escapes the inner function so that it is evaluated properly.\n\nageCurve\n  .filter(aq.escape(d =&gt; d.currentAge &gt; 35))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk but you might asking yourself, why don’t I just do that in dplyr? The beauty of these ojs chunks is that we let the user perform these operations on the fly using interactive tools like sliders, dropdown menus and radio buttons. For that we make use of ObservableJS Inputs. Let’s make two of these – a slider and a dropdown. The slider (via Inputs.range) will define the variable age_cutoff and we can use that value to filter the ageCurve table updating the filteredAgeCurve data as a user interacts with the slider. We then take the filteredAgeCurve to determine unique player names and provide those as the values in the dropdown menu (via Inputs.select). One consequence of that is the values in the dropdown menu are dependent on the slider. Check for yourself. There are many fewer players to highlight at the age cutoff of 35.\nIt doesn’t get too exciting though until we start to visualize it. I am using the code-fold: true chunk option to hide the code that generates the plot and the inputs so that you can see the plot, the slider and the dropdown more closely together. Have a look at the code comments for a better idea of what is going on.\n\n\nCode\nviewof age_cutoff = Inputs.range([18, 40], {step: 1, value: 30})\n\n// capture the value of the slider and filter the ageCurve table\nfilteredAgeCurve = ageCurve\n  .filter(aq.escape(d =&gt; d.currentAge &gt; age_cutoff)) \n\n// get the unique player names alphabetically\norderedNames = filteredAgeCurve\n  .dedupe(\"fullName\")\n  .orderby(\"fullName\")\n  .array(\"fullName\")\n\n// setup the dropdown\nviewof player = Inputs.select(orderedNames, {value: \"Sidney Crosby\"})\n\n// filter the filteredAgeCurve table to the selected player\nsinglePlayer = filteredAgeCurve\n  .filter(aq.escape(d =&gt; d.fullName == player))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplotMarksHelper = function(data, color) {\n  return Plot.lineY(data, {\n    x: \"age_at_start_of_season\", \n    y: \"even_strength_points_per_60\", \n    z: \"fullName\",\n    stroke: color,\n    curve: \"basis\"\n  });\n}\n\n// setup the plot\nPlot.plot({\n  y: {label: \"Even Strength Points per 60\"},\n  x: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Age at the start of the season\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    // plot all lines above a certain age\n    // that filteredAgeCurve data changes as the slider changes\n    plotMarksHelper(filteredAgeCurve, \"lightgray\"), \n    // highlight the selected player in blue\n    plotMarksHelper(singlePlayer, \"blue\") \n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are using here the Plot library which also comes bundled with ojs in quarto. I find the code to create plots in ojs pretty accessible. Allison Horst wrote a really nice transition guide from ggplot2 to Plot that has proven to be very helpful. Plot draws from the same grammar of graphics that ggplot2 does so it’s spirit should feel familiar. Visual properties, like colour, are mapped to variables in the data\nI have not quite found the best way to write nice (read: not smelly) code in ojs but the results are undeniably useful. The plots are beautiful and interactive. Plot provides so many different opportunities for interactivity than other interactive plotting libraries like plotly or ggiraph. Those are great libraries but creating visualization from scratch in ojs feel more natural and flexible."

    "text": "Conclusion\nI would be remiss to just have a pretty plot and not say anything about the data. The slider and the player selector both provide a simple way to explore the data. A couple points to note:\n\nThe overall trend is that many players start to decline at around 30. However there is some clear selection bias here. Players that are not producing at a high level are not going to be playing at 35.\nSidney Crosby is a beast. He is still producing at a consistently high level at 35.\nThe players that you would expect display truly stunning numbers. Nathan Mckinnon is just getting better and better and at 26, there is nothing to suggest that he is slowing down. Connor McDavid entered the league at a stunning pace and has consistency kept it up.\nJoel Pavelski is a complete of an outlier. He produced his best season at 38.\nCorey Perry is also an outlier but in the opposite direction. He has been in a strong decline since he was 30. And yet all he does is compete for Cups so clearly he’s still doing something right.\n\nTo wrap this up, I think that ojs is a great way to create interactive visualizations. I’ve tried to highlight the handoff from R to ojs and illustrate how you might go about creating a plot.\n\nPhoto by Jeremy Bishop on Unsplash"
