The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). Please enjoy this volcano created with base R graphics:

```{r}
# Load the volcano dataset
data(volcano)

# Set the plot background color
par(bg = "#231409")

# Create a custom color palette for the plot
fg_color <- "#7B8DD6"
bg_color <- "#1B1B1B"
terrain_colors <- terrain.colors(100, alpha = 0.8)
custom_colors <- c(bg_color, fg_color, rev(terrain_colors))

# Create a 3D plot with a dark theme and custom colors
persp(
  volcano,
  theta = 30,
  phi = 30,
  col = custom_colors,
  xlab = "X", ylab = "Y",
  zlab = "Height", 
  box = FALSE, 
  axes = FALSE
)

```

Sorry about that!
